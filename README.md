# Who Made This Image?  
## Beyond Detection: Identifying the Generators of AI-Generated Images

## 📌 Project Overview

![Project Overview](./assests/architecture.png)
This project focuses on **AI image generator attribution**, moving beyond simple real-vs-fake detection to identify **which AI model generated a given image**.  
By analyzing generator-specific visual characteristics, the project aims to support **proactive defense, forensic analysis, and accountability** in the era of advanced image synthesis.

We systematically explore combinations of **pretrained vision models** operating at different representation levels to capture complementary cues from AI-generated images.

# Implementation Guide
This project was designed to be executed in a **GPU-enabled environment**. To ensure reproducibility and ease of setup, **all experiments were conducted using Google Colab via `main.ipynb`**.

## 🚀 Recommended: Run on Google Colab (GPU)

### Dataset

- The `data.zip` file can be downloaded from **Google Drive**:  
  👉 [**data.zip**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10b1yPJOOsW2nCoZcNUPlVIDjccWcax_o/view?usp=drive_link)

### Pretrained Weights

- The **MFM_pretrained_vit_base** weights are available on **Google Drive**:  
  👉 [**MFM_pretrained_vit_base**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qgMuODAxAapwXZXbH2Bgo5s5O_zc1bdl/view)

### Steps

1. Download and unzip the provided `data.zip` file.
2. Download the **MFM_pretrained_vit_base** pretrained weights.
3. Upload the extracted data folder **and** the pretrained weight file to **Google Drive**.
4. Open `main.ipynb` in **Google Colab** and run all cells sequentially.

> ⚠️ Make sure that Colab is set to use a **GPU runtime** (`Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU`).
